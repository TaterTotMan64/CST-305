How to run:
- Use Python 3.12

Using Python file "Project 8 – Numerical Integration.py":
1. Open Python code: "Project 8 – Numerical Integration.py"
2. Install these packages:
 a. numpy
 b. matplotlib
 c. scipy
3. Run the program

Note: "Project 8 – Numerical Integration.ipynd" is there just to show the outputs and to prove that we
    were able to run the program ourselves so it doesn't need to be run.
